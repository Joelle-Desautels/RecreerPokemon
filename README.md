# RecreerPokemon

In my program, we had to learn one language or framework on our own. I choose UNITY. Either to satisfy my gaming passion or to challenge me even more while doing something that we haven't done before.

For the purpose of the exercice, I decided te recreate the basis of a pokemon game. 
So far, I have been able to create the main walking scene.
Basically, one caracter moving around. There is an interaction with a NPC and a random encounter with a "pokemon".


Of course the real pokemon artwork would be out of price and I had only four weeks to learn and create somethine completely new. So I decided to go for something less expensive.
